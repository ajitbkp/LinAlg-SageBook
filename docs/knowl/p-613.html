<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> be a vector space over <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> a nonempty subset of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Assume that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is closed under addition and scalar multiplication on <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> to be a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we need to show that all the eight properties in definition of vector space must be satisfied for elements in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Fortunately, our task is simplified as most of these properties are inherited from the vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(w\in W\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(0\cdot w=0\in W\text{.}\)</span> Note that we require <span class="process-math">\(W\neq \emptyset\)</span> for this property. Also for <span class="process-math">\(w\in W\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((-1)w=-w\in W\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> contains the additive identity and additive inverse. Remaining conditions are true as elements in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and hence are also true as elements of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> This show that if <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> nonempty subset of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> which is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, then it is subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span></p>
