<p>In this section, we deal with one of the most important matrix factorization tools, called the singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD of a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is closely related to eigen decomposition of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(AA^T\text{.}\)</span> One can also think of this as a generalization of diagonalization procedure that allows us to diagonalize any matrix not necessarily square matrix. The SVD is computationally a viable tool for a wide variety of applications. It has applications in image and signal processing, control theory, least square problems, time series analysis, pattern recognition, dimensionality reduction, biomedical engineering and defining a generalized inverse of a matrix and many more. We shall deal with few of these applications.</p>
