  "body": " Elementary Operations  The solution of a system of linear equations is unchanged if the following operations are performed. If, fact this is the basis for solving a system of linear equations.   Multiply one of the equations by a nonzero real number. This is equivalent to multiplying one of the rows of the augmented matrix of the system by a non-zero real number.  Multiply one of the equations by a real number and add the result to another equation, leaving the original equation unchanged. This is equivalent to multiplying one of the rows of the augmented matrix of the system by a real number and adding it to another row, leaving the original row unchanged.  Interchanging two equations. This is equivalent to interchanging two rows of the augmented matrix of the system.  Bring the equations which are equivalent to to the bottom row. This is equivalent to moving the zero rows (rows with zero entries) of the augmented matrix to the bottom.   If an equation of the system after the elementary after reduces to , where , then the system has no solution. This is equivalent to if a row of the augmented matrix is composed of zeros except for the last number, then the system has no solution.   Elementary row operations   The following operations on a matrix are called elementary row operations.   interchange of two rows of a matrix;  multiplication of one row by a non-zero scalar ;  adding a scalar times a row to another row.        A matrix is said to be equivalent or row equivalent to matrix , in notation , if can be obtained from by performing finite number of elementary row operations.    Row operations on a matrix can be obtained by matrix multiplication. Before we see this, let us look at the following observations.  Let be an matrix of real numbers. Let the columns of are , that is . Let the rows of are given by , in particular, . Let are standard coordinate vectors in , where is the column matrix (vector) whose -th entry is 1 and rest are zero. That is . Then we have the following:   for each . That is, -th column can be obtained by multiplying by on the right.   for each . That is, -th row can be obtained by multiplying by on the left.   for .           Let denote an elementary row operation and the result of applying to a . Let be a matrix obtained by applying to the identity matrix. That is, . Then is called the elementary matrix corresponding to the elementary row operation . It is easy to see that an elementary matrix is non singular. (why?)     Elementary Matrix Theorem   Let be an elementary row operation and , the corresponding elementary matrix defined by . Then, for any matrix , .        Let be a rectangular matrix of order . Let be a matrix obtained by interchanging 2nd and 3rd rows of . Then where .  What is ?    Let be the matrix obtained by multiplying 2nd row of by a scalar . Then where .  What is ?    Let be the matrix obtained by adding 2 times 2nd row to the 3rd rows of in place of the 3rd row. Then where .  What is ?        Two matrices and are row equivalent if and only if there exists a non singular matrix such that .      Since is row equivalent to , there exists elementary row matrices such that write . Define , which is a non singular.     Matrix Inversion via Elementary Row Operations  We can use the theorem to find the inverse of a matrix using elementary row operations. If a matrix is non singular and is row equivalent to the identity matrix by a sequence of elementary row operations say , then we have, . This implies . In other words, the sequence of elementary row operations required to turn into also turns into . Thus to find inverse of , we adjoin to on the right to give the augmented matrix , and perform elementary row operations on that successively reduces to the identity matrix and then extract from the right half of the transformed augmented matrix.   Find the inverse of using row operations.          Hence   Let solve the abobe problem step by step in Sage. Sage has inbuilt functions to do elementary row operations.                             Sage can directly find the inverse of a matrix.       "
