<p>An Internet network can be represented by a directed graph in which each website is thought of as a node or vertex and links between pages are edges with arrows. If there is an arrow from note <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(j\text{,}\)</span> them it means that there is link to move from webpage <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(j\text{.}\)</span> If there is a double arrow between <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(j\text{,}\)</span> then there is link from <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> and also from <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span></p>
