  <title>Sytem of Linear Equation</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        In daily life we often encounter problems where several unknown quantities are related to each other through linear relations. Such problems naturally lead to a system of linear equations. A system of linear equations consists of several linear equations in the same set of variables. Each equation represents a constraint, and the simultaneous solution of all equations corresponds to finding the values of the unknowns that satisfy all the constraints at once.
    </p>
    <p>
Studying systems of linear equations is fundamental for several reasons. They arise directly in practical applicationsâ€”for instance, balancing chemical reactions, analyzing electrical networks, studying forces in equilibrium, or modeling data in statistics. Also they form the backbone of Linear Algebra, since the methods developed for their solution lead naturally to the concepts of vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrix theory.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before moving to abstract notions of linear algebra, it is important to understand how such systems are represented, how they can be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let us start with real life a problem.

    </p>
</introduction>


    <example xml:id="sec1-0-eg1">
  <statement>
    <p>
    A person travels from <m>City\;A</m> to <m>City\;B</m> using a train and a bus.  
    The train runs at a speed of <m>60</m> km/h while the bus runs at <m>40</m> km/h.  
    The total journey takes <m>5</m> hours and the total distance covered is <m>240</m> km.  
    Find how much time the person spent on the train and on the bus. 
    </p>
</statement>
   
    <solution>
        <p>
    Let <m>x</m> be the time spent on the train (in hours), and  
    <m>y</m> be the time spent on the bus (in hours).  
    Then the problem gives us two conditions:
    <ol>
      <li>Total travel time is <m>5</m> hours:
        <me>x + y = 5.</me>
      </li>
      <li>Total distance is <m>240</m> km:
        <me>60x + 40y = 240.</me>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Thus the system of equations is:
    <me>
      \begin{cases}
      x + y = 5, \\
      60x + 40y = 240.
      \end{cases}
    </me>
    How do we solve these equations?
</p>
<p>
    From the first equation, <m>y = 5 - x</m>.  
    Substituting into the second equation, we have 
    <me>60x + 40(5 - x) = 240.</me>
    Simplifying this we get <m>60x + 200 - 40x = 240,</m>. This implies     <m>x = 2.</m>
    Hence, <m>y = 5 - 2 = 3.</m>
</p>
    <p>Therefore, the person spent <m>2</m> hours on the train and <m>3</m> hours on the bus.</p>
  </solution>
  </example>
<p>
   The above problem was easy to formaulate and solve. What if the problem involves more variables?  Condsider the following situation now.
</p>

<example xml:id="sec1-0-eg2">
     <statement>
    A traveler goes from <m>City\;A</m> to <m>City\;B</m> in three legs:
    by car at <m>50</m> km/h, by train at <m>80</m> km/h, and by ferry at <m>20</m> km/h.
    The total travel time is <m>10</m> hours, and the total distance covered is <m>520</m> km.
    It is also known that the time on the train equals the sume of time in the car and in ferry. Formulate this problem and fine the time (in hours) spent on each mode of transport.
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
        Let <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> denote the hours spent by car, train, and ferry, respectively.
    Then the conditions give:
    <ol>
      <li>Total time:
        <me>x + y + z = 6.</me>
      </li>
      <li>Total distance:
        <me>50x + 80y + 20z = 520.</me>
      </li>
      <li> Car plus ferry time is equal to train time:
        <me>x+z = y.</me>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Hence the linear system is
    <me>
      \begin{cases}
        x + y + z = 6,\\
        50x + 80y + 20z = 520,\\
        x-y+z = 0.
      \end{cases}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is easy to solve the above system.   
    It turns out that <m>x = 2, y= 5</m> and <m>z = 3</m>.
    Hence the traveler spends <m>2</m> hours by car, <m>5</m> hours by train, and <m>3</m> hours by ferry.
    </p>
  </solution>

<example xml:id="chemical-reaction-eg1">
  <title>Balancing Chemical Reaction Equation</title>
  
  
  <statement>
    <p>
    The combustion of octane (<m>C_8H_{18}</m>) is a classical example of a hydrocarbon fuel 
    reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water. The unbalanced reaction is:
    <me>
    C_8H_{18} + O_2 \to CO_2 + H_2O.
  </me>
Balancing this  chemical equation can be expressed as solving a 
system of linear equations. Let us carefully set this up for the combustion of octane:
<p>
  This amounts to finding <m>x,y,z,w</m> such that 
  <me>
        xC_8H_{18} + yO_2 \to zCO_2 + wH_2O.
  </me>
Equating the number of carbons, hydrogen and oxygen atoms on both side gives the 
following equations. 
<md>
  <mrow>8x \amp=\amp z </mrow>
    <mrow>18x \amp=\amp 2w </mrow>
  <mrow>2y \amp=\amp 2z+w </mrow>
</md>  
By solving the above equations one of the soltutions is given by 
<m>
  x=2, y=25, z=16, w=18
</m>. Hence the balanced equation can be written as
 <me>
        2C_8H_{18} + 25O_2 \to 16CO_2 + 18H_2O.
  </me>
</p>  
</p>
  </statement>
</example>

<p>
  Let us consider another example about distribution of taxies 
  at various location in a certain city.
</p>

<example xml:id="taxi-distribution-eg1">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the figure below <xref ref="taxi_fig1"/>. Vertices are 
      various locations at which taxies are parked. The edges are directed with 
      labels. 
    <figure xml:id="taxi_fig1">
	<sidebyside width="80%">
	  <image source="images/taxi_fig1.png" />
	</sidebyside>
	 <caption>Taxi distributions between 5 locations.
  </caption>
</figure>
For example arrow going from location 4 to 1 has label 
      <m>7/20</m>. This means <m>7/20^{th}=35\%</m> of the taxies taken from location 
      <m>4</m> comes to location <m>1</m> at the end of the day.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Now suppose a company is running this taxi services and has certain 
      number of taxies. The above proportation of distribution has been otained 
      from some past experience. Suppose the comany has a total, <m>N</m> taxies
    and wish to find out how many taxies he/she should place at various location 
    so that his business runs smoothly.  How to formulate this problem? 
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose <m>x_i</m> denotes the number of taxies to be kept at the 
      locatio <m>i</m>. Then we have 
      <me>
        x_0+x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=N.
      </me>
      How many taxies will be there at the location <m>0</m> after one day. 
      It is easy to see that it is 
      <me>
        1/4x_0 + 1/10x_1 + 3/20x_2 + 1/10x_3 + 3/10x_4.
      </me>
      Similarly the number of taxies at various locations are as follows
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Location 1: <m>1/5x_0 + 1/10x_1 + 1/5x_2 + 1/4x_3</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Location 2: <m>3/20x_0 + 1/5x_1 + 1/2x_2 + 1/10x_3 + 7/20x_4</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Location 3: <m>7/20x_0 + 1/4x_1 + 7/20x_3 + 1/10x_4</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Location 4: <m>1/20x_0 + 7/20x_1 + 3/20x_2 + 1/5x_3 + 1/4x_4</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
    Ideally, the company would want the same number of taxies to come back at 
    each location everyday.  How to find these <m>x_i's</m>? It is easy to see
    that this amount to solving the following system of linear equations
    <md>
      <mrow> 1/4x_0 + 1/10x_1 + 3/20x_2 + 1/10x_3 + 3/10x_4\amp =\amp x_0</mrow>

      </md>
  The above equations can be written in a matrix form as follows:

    \left(\begin{array}{rrrrr}

\end{array}\right) = 
\left(\begin{array}{rrrrr}
x_{0} \\ x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{3} \\x_{4}

  The above equation can be written as

Note that the preoblem in <xref ref="taxi-distribution-eg1"/> involves 
 only 5 depos. What if we have hundreds of depos? How do we solve such problems?
 In fact, google seach uses millions by million equations. It turns out that 
 solving this problem amounts to finding large power of the 
 coefficient matrix <m>A</m> whihc is not an easy task even for 
 poweful computers. This is acheived by notion of diagonalization 
 whihc and numerical computaions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large

     Our goal in this chapter is to find the solution set <m>S</m> of a system of 
     equations <m>Ax=b</m>. Let us first find solution set involving one equation involving one and 
     two variables.
     <example xml:id="one-eqn-one-var">
      <statement>
        <p>
          One linear equation in one variable <m>x</m> can be written as 
          <men xml:id="one-eqn-one-var-eqn1">
            ax =b,
          </men>
          where, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          How to find the solution set of this  equation.  We need to find 
          <m>x\in\R</m> such that the equation holds. Does it mean <m>x=b/a</m>? What if <m>a=0</m>? 
          Thus we need to consider different cases on <m>a</m>. If <m>S</m> is the solution set of 
          this equation then we have   
		<me>
      S = \begin{cases}
      \emptyset, \amp \text{ if }  a=0\\
      \R, \amp \text{ if } a=0, b=0\\
      \{b/a\}, \amp \text{ if } a\neq 0\\
      \end{cases}.

      </statement>
     </example>

       <example xml:id="two-eqn-one-var">
      <statement>
        <p>
          One linear equation in two variable <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be written as 
          <men xml:id="two-eqn-one-var-eqn1">
            ax+by =c,
          </men>
          where, <m>a, b</m> and <m>c</m> are real numbers. 
          How to find the solution set <m>S</m> of this equation?
        </p>
        </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
           In this case, we need to consider two cases: (i) <m>a=0=b</m>
and (ii) at least one of <m>a, b </m>is nonzero.  If <m>a=0=b</m>, then the solution 
depends upon <m>c</m>. If <m>c=0</m>, then <m>S=\R</m> and if <m>c\neq 0</m>, then <m>S=\emptyset</m>, 
the empty/null set. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In the second case, the solution set has geometric
interpretation, it is that the set of
all points on a straight line. For example, if
<m>b\neq 0</m>, then the set of solutions is the straight line in the
plane through the point <m>(0,c/b)</m> and with slope <m>-a/b</m>.  
If <m>b=0</m>, then also the  solution set is a straight line. Can you identify
it?
</p>
<p>
  Can you write the solution set explicitley by taking all the possible cases?

  <p>
   The solution set of one linear equation <m>ax+by=c</m>, where <m>a,b,c\in \R</m> in two variables 
  is a straight line provides <m>(a,b)\neq (0,0)</m>, that is, one of the coefficients <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> 
  is non-zero.
