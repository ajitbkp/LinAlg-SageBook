    <title>Preface</title>
    <p>
        This book, <title><em>Linear Algebra with SageMath: A Gentle Introduction</em></title>, 
        is designed as a self-contained, accessible pathway into linear algebra with an emphasis 
        on computation using SageMath. It begins with familiar topics such as systems of linear 
        equations and elementary row operations, then systematically expands into topics like 
        vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues, orthogonality, inner product spaces, 
        regression, singular value decomposition, and principal component analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        The text is based on the author’s course of lectures for engineering students, refined 
        over several years of teaching and integrating computational approaches into the curriculum.
    </p>
    <p>
        A distinctive feature of the book is its consistent use of the 
        <term>Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)</term> as a central computational tool. 
        The RREF approach is not only essential for solving systems of equations, but also proves 
        to be a unifying and highly effective method for a wide range of computations in linear algebra.
    </p>
    <p>Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Gradual structure</em>: Each chapter builds on the previous one, starting from 
            Gaussian elimination, advancing through theory with geometric intuition and computational examples.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Interactive learning</em>: SageMath examples, computational exercises, and “Sage Computations” 
            sections scattered throughout the text reinforce concepts through hands-on experimentation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Applied focus</em>: Special applications—such as polynomial fitting, Markov chains, 
            image compression, and PCA—highlight how linear algebra underpins both theoretical and practical domains.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Balanced pedagogy</em>: Rigour and intuition go hand-in-hand. Abstract notions like 
            inner product spaces and orthogonal complements are grounded by SageMath implementations, 
            guiding both self-learners and classroom users.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I hope this text serves as an inviting and productive introduction to linear algebra, equipping 
        readers with both conceptual clarity and computational competence as they progress through topics 
        and exercises.
