  <title>Elementary Column Operations</title>
<p>
    Elementary column operations are the column analogue of elementary row operations. Their
precise properties can be deduced by applying elementary row operations to the transpose of a
matrix and then transposing the result. In particular, if <m>F</m> is the elementary matrix corresponding to
the elementary column operation <m>f</m> then <m>f(A) = AF</m>. Note that, because transposition changes the
order of a product, elementary column operations correspond to post-multiplication by an
elementary matrix. Two matrices that are related by a sequence of elementary column operations
are said to be column equivalent and two matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are column equivalent if and only if there
exists a non singular matrix <m>Q</m> such that <m> B = AQ</m>.
