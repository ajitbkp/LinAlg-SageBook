        <title>Vector Subspaces</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>
    In linear algebra, we often encounter a set of vectors that themselves 
    possess the structure of a vector space, but live naturally inside a larger 
    vector space. For example, the set of all solutions to a homogeneous system 
    of linear equations in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> may  not the whole space 
    <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, yet it still satisfies the axioms of a vector space. 
    Such subsets, closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, are 
    called <term>subspaces</term>. 
            </p>

          <title>Vector subspace</title>  
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>V</m> be a vector space over <m>\R</m> and <m>W</m> a nonempty subset of <m>V</m>.
              The <m>W</m> is called a subspace of <m>V</m>,
              if <m>W</m> itself is a vector space under the inherited vector addition and scalar multiplication on <m>V</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </definition>

        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
              If <m>V</m> is a vector space over <m>\R</m>,
              then <m>\{0\}</m> and <m>V</m> are two trivial subspaces of <m>V</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </example>

        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a vector space over <m>\R</m> and <m>W</m> a nonempty subset of <m>V</m>.
          Assume that <m>W</m> is closed under addition and scalar multiplication on <m>V</m>.
          For <m>W</m> to be a subspace of <m>V</m>,
          we need to show that all the eight properties in definition of vector space must be satisfied for elements in <m>W</m>.
          Fortunately,
          our task is simplified as most of these properties are inherited from the vector space <m>V</m>.
          Let <m>w\in W</m>, the <m>0\cdot w=0\in W</m>.
          Note that we require <m>W\neq \emptyset</m> for this property.
          Also for <m>w\in W</m>, <m>(-1)w=-w\in W</m>.
          Thus <m>W</m> contains the additive identity and additive inverse.
          Remaining conditions are true as elements in <m>V</m> and hence are also true as elements of <m>W</m>.
          This show that if <m>W</m> nonempty subset of <m>V</m> which is closed under addition and scalar multiplication,
          then it is subspace of <m>V</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If <m>W</m> itself is a vector space under the addition and scalar multiplication on <m>V</m>,
          then <m>W</m> is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
          Thus we have the following result.
        </p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-subspace1">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>V</m> be a vector space over <m>\R</m> and <m>W</m> a nonempty subset of <m>V</m>.
              Then <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m> if and only if <m>W</m> is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </theorem>

        <p>
          Thus in order to check that if a nonempty subset <m>W\subset V</m> is a subspace,
          all we need to check that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication inherited from <m>V</m>.

              (why?).
              However, it is closed under addition.
